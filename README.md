# Automated-Document-Summarizer
This project is a Streamlit-based web app that summarizes uploaded PDF documents using Google's Gemini AI. It supports both summarization and question-answering based on the content. Users upload a PDF, get an instant summary, and can ask questions about the document for contextual answers.
